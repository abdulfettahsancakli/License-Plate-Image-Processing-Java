# Image Processing with License Plate & Java

1) Open a jpeg (jpg) file (color or gray scale image) save it as text based type 2 or 3 file with the
same name as the original file name.

2) Create 6 tabs in your GUI application. And show the following in each tab:
- 2.1 The original image
- ![Original](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/License-Plate-Image-Processing-Java/blob/main/Screenshots/Originalimage.JPG)
- 2.2 The grayscale image (if the original image is a grayscale image) of the original image.
- ![Grayscale](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/License-Plate-Image-Processing-Java/blob/main/Screenshots/GrayscaleImage.JPG)
- 2.3 The binary image (the black and white image) of the original image. Use a global threshold
value so that pixels that are greater than the threshold value become white and those smaller
become black.

- 2.4  Find the horizontal projection of the binarized image (as we discussed in class). Show it on
your tab (do not use any library for that).
- ![Horizontal](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/License-Plate-Image-Processing-Java/blob/main/Screenshots/HorizontalProjection.JPG)
- 2.5 Find the vertical projection of the binarized image (as we discussed in class). Show it on
your tab (do not use any library).
- ![Vertical](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/License-Plate-Image-Processing-Java/blob/main/Screenshots/VerticalProjection.JPG)
- 2.6 I am providing a license plate for you. Using (4) and (5) to find the characters (digit and
letters) in the license plate and put a red box around them.
